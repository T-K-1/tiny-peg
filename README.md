# tiny-peg
tiny-peg is a parser generator based on the Parsing Expression Grammar. This is implemented in C/C++.  

# Features
* Extremely simple implementation (7 lines or 20 lines or so)  
* Disappointingly, this tiny-peg is probably "not cool."  

# Versions
There are four versions: tiny-peg var1.0, ver2.0, ver2.1 and ver3.0.  

* We only need 7 lines to implement tiny-peg ver1.0, though we can not use "*" (zero-or-more) or "!" (not-predicate) or "&" (and-predicate) or "?" (optional) in this version.  
* We only need 20 lines to implement tiny-peg ver2.0. This version meets the requirements of PEG.  
* We only need 22 lines to implement tiny-peg ver2.1. This version is a slight extension of PEG.  
* We only need 21 lines to implement tiny-peg ver3.0. This version is a refactoring of ver2.1.  
* We only need C Language to implement tiny-peg, if we do not implement "*" (zero-or-more).  

# Samples
There are nine samples and one png file. Each sample works individually.
